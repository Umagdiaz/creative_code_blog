        The world’s largest computer museum in provincial Paderborn sends hundreds of thousands of visitors each year on a dizzying journey through almost 6,000 years of human history. It begins on the second floor with cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia, leads past Johannes Gutenberg’s letterpress printing, shows the transformation of mechanical calculators and typewriters over the centuries, and then focuses visitors’ gaze on the short time period of the last 100 years on the second floor

        Near a clunky IBM computer from the 1970s, the giggles of teenagers can be heard again and again. Black-and-white photos show people in offices wearing strange smocks, sitting in front of huge machines with tiny tube screens, dully hacking characters into keyboards. At that time, computers could already be found in research facilities and large companies, but nowhere near private homes. There was still no good reason to buy a computer, because the monstrously large machines were not only unimaginably expensive, but also completely useless for private purposes. To make matters worse: Anyone who wanted to operate a computer had to program it. There were neither modern programming languages that were easy to read, nor anything like the Internet, where people could quickly and easily search for the right solution.

        Parisian artist Vera Molnar has become famous for knowing how to tame these early versions of the computer. Towards the end of the 1960s, she was one of the first people in the world to use the promising machine as an artistic tool. Today she is considered a pioneer of computer art and creative coding.

        <p class="content__text-quotes">
            "(Creative Coding) is a process, based on exploration, iteration, reflection and discovery, where code is used as the primary medium to create a wide range of media artifacts."

        But what exactly does creative coding mean? In my eyes, most definitions fail because they try to explain the term on the basis of a medium. The entry on Wikipedia is a good example, because it directly lists examples of use, which strongly narrow the view of the reader and thus only allow a very limited view of the technology itself. To me it seems more useful to define the term more abstractly, as Mark C. Mitchell and Oliver Bown do.
