        The world’s largest computer museum in provincial Paderborn sends hundreds of thousands of visitors each year on a dizzying journey through almost 6,000 years of human history. It begins on the second floor with cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia, leads past Johannes Gutenberg’s letterpress printing, shows the transformation of mechanical calculators and typewriters over the centuries, and then focuses visitors’ gaze on the short time period of the last 100 years on the second floor

At that time, computers could already be found in research facilities and large companies, but nowhere near private homes. There was still no good reason to buy a computer, because the monstrously large machines were not only unimaginably expensive, but also completely useless for private purposes. To make matters worse: Anyone who wanted to operate a computer had to program it.

        But what exactly does creative coding mean? In my eyes, most definitions fail because they try to explain the term on the basis of a medium.
